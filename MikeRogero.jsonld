    "motivations": "The Cardano ecosystem won the lottery when control of the protocol and treasury was handed to the community. But like most lottery winners, we risk squandering these resources and ending up broke. That’s why I volunteered to be a DRep—because Cardano has the potential to become a global powerhouse, but only if we manage its resources wisely. Too many see the treasury as ‘other people’s money,’ and that mindset will lead us to failure.\n\nWe’ve been given something valuable, and how we manage it will define Cardano’s future. If we waste these resources, we’ll become a cautionary tale. My goal as a DRep is to ensure every investment grows both the ecosystem and the treasury. We must demand discipline, focus on return-based spending, and stick to crypto’s core principles: fixed monetary policy and responsible inflation.\n\nI’m not here just to stop waste—I’m here to help Cardano realize its potential. Together, we can build a sustainable, thriving ecosystem positioned for long-term success.",
    "objectives": "For centuries, the economy was constrained by trust. Family businesses dominated because trusting others with cash or goods was risky. That changed in 1458 when Luca Pacioli introduced double-entry bookkeeping, reducing the need for trust and enabling businesses to scale to corporations, laying the foundation for our global economy.\n\nYet, even with this system, risks remained: Can we trust accounts, amounts, and promises, knowing they could be altered? Blockchain is the next evolution of trust. It makes every transaction verifiable, every decision traceable, and every record immutable. Blockchain doesn’t eliminate bad actors, but it makes it far harder for them to do damage, creating a new era of built-in transparency.\n\nI believe Cardano is the best platform to build that trust-less financial ecosystem which will benefit all mankind. As a DRep, I’m committed to helping guide Cardano toward that end.",

    "qualifications": "With over 30 years of experience in advertising and technology sales, I know how quickly money and time can be burned on ineffective strategies and marketing. As a financial analyst and fraud examiner, I’ve learned to question every promise and scrutinize every report. My training in anti-money laundering helps me spot red flags that could erode trust in our ecosystem. I bring these skills to ensure that Cardano’s resources aren’t just preserved, but grown and optimized for the long term.\n\nI hold the following credentials: \nMBA from INSEAD\nCFA Charter holder (Chartered Financial Analyst)\nCFE (Certified Fraud Examiner)\nCAMS (Certified Anti-money laundering specialist)\nBA American University's School of International Service",
