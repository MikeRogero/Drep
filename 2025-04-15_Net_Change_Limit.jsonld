    "comment": "My disagreement with this proposal is in the concept of equaling Cardano's outflows to inflows.  I would like Cardano to continue to build its treasury into a sovereign wealth fund which will increase its value to the community over time and bring compounding interest.  While I appreciate the rigor of modeling the inflows in this proposal, the NCL should be set less than expected inflows along with the expectation that total of approved budgets will be even smaller.\n\nI agree with this proposal that the NCL needs to be clearly defined, and salute this attempt to do so, but it is still too high.  I also took minor issue with choosing a starting point in time, prior to the epoch when this will be decided."
