    "comment": "\nDRep Report: I Voted Yes on the Constitution\nBy Michael Rogero, Constitutional Delegate Representing the Taipei Cardano Community\n\nI voted “yes” on the Constitution after careful consideration. While I have concerns about elements I believe are missing or malformed, the value of maintaining momentum towards decentralization, the Constitution’s valid reflection of the will of the people, and the fact that this is a significant step along the original roadmap override those concerns. I believe both the Cardano ecosystem and the wider world will be better off with this Constitution passed—even if it has some warts—so I cast my vote in favor.\n\n\nThe Constitution Reflects the Community Will\n\nCardano has always been a coalition of the willing. It was founded by people who aiming to fix fundamental flaws in the traditional financial system and other early blockchains. Many of us arrived later, inspired by that vision and eager to improve upon the initial framework while helping the ecosystem grow.\n\nSince I joined 2018, I’ve seen a community of builders choosing this ecosystem to build in, in spite of the fact that most of these people could have earned more on other chains or in other industries. They stayed because they wanted to push forward the vision originally laid out by Charles, which has since grown and evolved to reflect the dreams and ideals of a broader global community.\n\nThis “created by the willing” spirit also shaped the Constitution. While a small team of professionals wrote the initial draft, people from around the world added to it, rewrote it, and picked apart every sentence, sharing their opinions on how well it reflected the will of their own communities and lived experience. Because of limited time and the large, diverse group—many without formal legal drafting experience—some things didn’t get as much scrutiny as we might have hoped. This Constitution may be an imperfect outcome, but still a big step forward toward the goal.\n\nAn alternative process would be something like the Cardano Foundation’s Constitution, which crafted by a smaller professional group in many ways is a cleaner document, but a centralized system isn’t what we set out to build. My hope is that the Community Constitution can be updated with better ideas in the future, but for this first step, starting with what the global community argued over, edited and ratified is the right choice.\n\n\nThe Constitution Reflects More Work Than Is Immediately Visible\n\nMy experience with the Constitution, beginning with the local 1694 workshop almost two years ago, going through DRep training, participating in the Constitutional Summits in Taipei and Nairobi, attending the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, and joining many late-night sessions to finalize details like the definitions addendum—this process demanded countless hours of negotiation, argument, and refinement. Starting from that experience, I look around and see so many people who devoted many multiples of the time I did in order to get us here.\n\nWe shouldn’t overlook the extraordinary effort and coordination it took to form the initial drafts and get this document to its current form.  This document represents a massive investment in human energy which shouldn’t be under valued, especially when it is likely more than sufficient structure for our ecosystem to function and evolve.\n\n\nThis Version Still Doesn’t Satisfy Me\n\nI was elected as the representative from Taipei after promising that I’d push to add some clear moral standards in the document. Shortly before the Taipei Summit, there was an egregious incident in which multiple CNTs were minted using deep-fake nudes of various community members. While the action itself was obviously offensive and toxic, what bothered me more was that the Draft Constitution didn’t define any ethical codes which would address or even imply that such behavior was unconstitutional or even against community ethics.\n\nThe current text still doesn’t set out a moral standard similar to the Preamble of the U.S. Constitution. It does mention “our shared values” but then doesn’t specify what those are. I tried to include such principles in Nairobi and Buenos Aires but couldn’t convince a majority of the need. The fact that we don’t explicitly define lines that shouldn’t be crossed, or clarify an ethical code which unites us troubles me.  \n\n\nI Foresee Evolving This Document Will Be Hard\n\nGetting this document across the finish line took significant will—and financial backing—from Charles, IOG and Intersect, who committed to completing this process even if some warts remained.  As we heard repeatedly, done is better than endlessly striving for perfect. Getting to this point was essentially a case of herding a global community of cats that were engaged in endless debates.  Post ratification, to improve on this work we will be facing a global ecosystem often communicating by tweets, Discord chats, and other impersonal asynchronous communication tools that work against fostering consensus or thoughtful debate.  This is on top of the language, and culture barriers inherent in a global ecosystem. Democracy is messy, and decentralized democracy is exponentially hard.\n\nI suspect that updating the Constitution will be tougher than many delegates assume. The approval threshold for amendments is high, and consensus will be tough to reach. Without Charles’s persistent will, and wallet, I’m not sure we’d have gotten here in the first place. I’m skeptical the community will find the drive and effort needed to keep this a truly “living document,” as stated in Section One.\n\nStill, I believe this Constitution is solid enough that a democratic, decentralized financial ecosystem can grow under its framework. If it lets Cardano flourish, then despite any flaws, it deserves to pass.  Passing it provides a framework to build upon and a starting point if we absolutely need to correct course.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile there are parts of the Constitution I wish were stronger, ratifying it now best serves Cardano’s future. It maintains momentum towards the goal, fairly reflects the will and voice of our diverse global community, and aligns with our decentralized and democratic principles. If we are serious about improving and clarifying it later, we have the foundation on which to build. For now, warts and all, it is sufficient and I voted “yes.”\n"
